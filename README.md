# Lab: Estimating circles from corners

Welcome! We will here
- Create our own corner keypoint detector `CornerDetector`.
- Use detected corner keypoints and RANSAC to find a circle with the `CircleEstimator` class.

Start by cloning this repository on your machine. 
Then open the lab project in CLion.

The lab is carried out by following these steps:
1. [Get an overview](lab-guide/1-get-an-overview.md)
2. [Implement a corner feature detector](lab-guide/2-implement-a-corner-feature-detector.md)
3. [Detect circles from corners with RANSAC](lab-guide/3-detect-circles-from-corners-with-ransac.md)

At an appropriate time, [our proposed solution](https://github.com/tek5030/solution-corners) will be made available.

Please start the lab by going to the [first step](lab-guide/1-get-an-overview.md).
